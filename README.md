## Connected System Templates (CST) SDK
The Connected System Template (CST) SDK gives developers a toolkit for providing designers with simple, point-click integration experiences. With the SDK, developers can create CST plug-ins that appear alongside out-of-the-box templates like Google Natural Language Amazon Machine Learning in the Appian Designer UI.

## Certified SAIL Extensions (CSE) SDK
The Certified SAIL Extension (CSE) SDK enables developers to build their own SAIL components. CSEs can be used in SAIL interfaces like any other component. The SDK consists of a list of APIs to communicate between the CSE and the rest of the Appian interface.

## CSE and Client API (CST) SDK
The Client API in the CST SDK enables developers to build more complex CSEs with the support of serverside, java-based Client APIs. These Client APIs have access to the configurations stored in their parent Connected System.
